Problem 1

Install moderndive packages.

Load dataset
```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

Short description using R code.

The `early_january_weather` dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.  
- **time_hour**: date and hour of the observation  
- **temp** (°F): hourly temperature readings  
- **humid** (%): relative humidity  
- **wind_speed**, **wind_dir**, **precip**, **pressure**: additional weather information  
The mean temperature across all observations is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` °F.
