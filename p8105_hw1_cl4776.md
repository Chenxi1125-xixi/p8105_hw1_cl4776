# Problem 1

## Install moderndive packages.

## Load dataset

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Short description using R code.

The `early_january_weather` dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.  
- **time_hour**: date and hour of the observation  
- **temp** (°F): hourly temperature readings  
- **humid** (%): relative humidity  
- **wind_speed**, **wind_dir**, **precip**, **pressure**: additional
weather information  
The mean temperature across all observations is 39.6 °F.

## Scatterplot of temp vs time_hour, colored by humid.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
p_weather = ggplot(
  early_january_weather,
  aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time (colored by Humidity)",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (°F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

p_weather
```

Patterns: Temperatures show a daily (diurnal) cycle, being higher in the
day and lower at night. Observations with higher humidity often coincide
with lower temperatures, suggesting an inverse relationship.

# export plot

``` r
ggsave("temp_vs_time_humid.png", plot = p_weather, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```
